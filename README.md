# MultiThreaded-WebCrawler

what this project does is that given a seed url, it will traverse through all the html tags in the page and find the pngs in it, it will continously keep going through links ##within the page to keep finding pngs.

as the user we can specify how many threads we want concurrenly searching pages. We keep track of any visited pages and also duplicate pngs.
